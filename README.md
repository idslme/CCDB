# ChemCorDB

Integrated Data Science Laboratory for Metabolomics and Exposomics (IDSL-ME) - Chemical Correlation Database (ChemCorDB) provides online access to indexed untargeted metabolomics datasets for retrieving correlating compounds for a single input prioritized query compound in a compound-centric approach. It enable learning of a chemical's relationships with other chemicals present in a metabolomics datasets. Key applications are to explore - exposure-metabolism, exposure-exposure and metabolite-metabolite relationships. 

# Recommend a database

To recommend a dataset to be included in the ChemCorDB, please submit the dataset in the [required format](https://github.com/idslme/chemcordb/blob/main/MTBSL204_INPUT.xlsx) in [the issue section of this repository](https://github.com/idslme/chemcordb/issues). We will index the dataset as soon as possible.
