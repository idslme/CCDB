# CCDB

Chemical Correlation Database (CCDB) by the Integrated Data Science Laboratory for Metabolomics and Exposomics (IDSL-ME) -  provides online access to inter-chemical correlation data indexed from untargeted metabolomics datasets. It can be used to retrieve correlating compounds for a single query compound in a compound-centric approach. It enable learning of a chemical's relationships with other chemicals reported in a metabolomics dataset. Key applications are to explore - exposure-metabolism, exposure-exposure and metabolite-metabolite relationships.
