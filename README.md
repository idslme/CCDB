# CCDB

Chemical Correlation Database (CCDB) by the Integrated Data Science Laboratory for Metabolomics and Exposomics (IDSL-ME) -  provides online access to inter-chemical correlation data indexed from untargeted metabolomics datasets. It can be used to retrieve correlating compounds for a single query compound in a compound-centric approach. It enable learning of a chemical's relationships with other chemicals reported in a metabolomics dataset. Key applications are to explore - exposure-metabolism, exposure-exposure and metabolite-metabolite relationships. 

# Recommend a dataset

To recommend a dataset to be included in the CCDB, please submit the dataset in the [required format](https://github.com/idslme/chemcordb/blob/main/MTBSL204_INPUT.xlsx) in [the issue section of this repository](https://github.com/idslme/chemcordb/issues). We will index the dataset in the database.
